# Coding-Challenges
All the course files (challenges &amp; solutions) for the Coding Challenges playlist on the Net Ninja YouTube channel.

### How to use the course files
Each challenge has its own branches in this repository - a starting point branch & a solution branch. For example the first challenge (slide in menu), has 2 branches:

- challenge-1-start
- challenge-1-solution

The ***challenge-1-start*** branch represents the starting point & initial code for the first challenge - this is where you should begin. The ***challenge-1-solution*** branch is the solution to the challenge & contains all the final code.
